# CRITICAL FIX: Large Files Causing Deployment Failure

## Problem Identified:
Found large files that were being included in Vercel deployment:
- `WikipediaExtractor.exe` (16.9 MB)
- `esbuild.exe` (9.5 MB) 
- `Build_release.zip` (37.6 MB)
- Multiple `base_library.zip` files (1.4 MB each)

Total: ~60+ MB of unnecessary files

## Solution Applied:
1. **Updated `.vercelignore`** to exclude these specific large files
2. **Minimized `api/requirements.txt`** to only essential packages
3. **Simplified `vercel.json`** configuration

## Files Modified:
- `.vercelignore` - Added specific exclusions for large files
- `api/requirements.txt` - Minimized dependencies
- `vercel.json` - Simplified configuration

## Expected Result:
- Deployment size should be under 250MB limit
- Vercel build should succeed
- App should deploy successfully

## Next Steps:
1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel should auto-deploy successfully
